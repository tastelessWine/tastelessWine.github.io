  <h1><center>INDIA a StartUp  </center>         </h1>
  <p>When India was reborn in 1947 after the bloody partition, things were not good, we were poor (although we are still poor), illitrate, divided on communal, cast, regional lines (princely states)
and other bunch of problems but let us see this with spectacles of startup.</p>
<p>
An idea was born where despite of all kind of differences (different language, religion, colour, cast, food, cloth) each individual can live their own way of life, without any kind of fear under the umberalla of one nation .</p>
<p>
<center><h2>Problems we were facing</h2> </center></p>
<p>
We were getting out from deadly partition which cost nearly 2 million lives , 15 million people migrated (largest in the human history), thousands died in communal voilence all over india, women got raped, both communities were not ready to see eye to eye.
At that time we were extremly poor, we did not had enough money to feed all, famine was pretty much common in those days. More than 500 princely state were present and each were playing their own game, some wanted bigger share of profit, some wanted independent nation .</p>
<center><img src="Art/parttion.jpg" alt="parttion"><br>

<p>
In 1947 only 12% of India was literate, rest was just bunch of illerate people, who wanted a democratic nation with voting rights to all, we were hugely divided based on caste, plenty of people were still called untouchables,they were not allowed to visit same temple and eat together, inter-caste marriage was only possible in dreams or heaven. We spoke more than 1652 languages, it means that many were not able to communicate with each other, we ate different food, we had different body shape and colour, let me tell you about women rights at that time, there were none, so after all this I can say that we were in total mess.   </p>
<p><center><h2>What we wanted </h2></center></p>
As a startup we wanted to solve the above problems, our dreams were to make a modern nation, give equal rights to all citizens, to remove poverty, to reach great height in science and technology but at that time we were just snake-charmer.
<center><img src="Art/snaakecharmer.jpg" alt="snake-charmer"><br>

</center>
<p><center><h2>How World saw us at that time</h2></center></p>
<p>
As our dream was very un-natural, like startups no venture capitalist wanted to invest on us, and they were saying we gonna die soon. Wiston Churchil said that if we give freedom to people of India then Nazi army will arrive to India to save hindus from muslims, one of the english newspaper editor based on Madras in 1952 said that India is going to have massive democratic election and this is first and the last one. America and whole other western nations were betting on pakistan saying that India is too diverse to survive and we will break in diffrent parts.
</p>

<center>
<h2>How we dealt it </h2></center>
<p>
Like Startup future decided by its founders, Indiaâ€™s future was also decided our founding fathers, we were blessed with great founding fathers. At that time we had great political leaders who realy cared about India and were ready to sacrifice anything. Among them four were most prominet Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Bhimrao Ambedkar and Jawaharlal Nehru. All of them had dispute with each other but they kept their nerve tight. They had different way to solve problem but had one goal which was to make our country great. Gandhiji gave us idea of non-violence and how to get Purna Swaraj, he not only dreamt to get freedom from Britian but also wanted to get freedom from poverty, casteism, illogical traditional practices. Sardar patel was like iron fist for India and he held us tight, he did great negotiation with princely states, he is the only reason why Indian poltical map include junaghar and hyderabad and many believed that he should be the first Prime Minister. Ambedkar gave us great constitution so that all people can enjoy equal rights and he also fought to reduce caste system and upliftment of dalits and tribals. Nehru was the first prime minister of India, he dreamt to make India rich in science and technology, modern views and his non alignment foriegn policies is well appreciated.</p>

<p>
<center>
<h2>What we Acheived </h2></center></p>
<p>
After almost 70 years we are still united dispite of all predictions, our litrecy rate have grown to 74% , we have not faced any famine, casteism is declining, minorities are flourshing, then we were called snake-charmers now we called mouse-charmer (computers), we are devloping some world class institution, we are booming ecomomy, we have 4th most powerful military, we have reached to mars, our soft power is influencing the whole world, we have great film industry and we are now called future superpower.</p>

</center>
<center><h2>What can be done better</h2></center>
 There is always  a room for improvement, we are still poor, per captia income is still very low we catched economic grwoth very late, our primary school system needs great amount of improvement, we are lagging behind healthcare and innovation, we need to build our infrastruture.We could had solve kashmir problem at early stage and we cannot forget the embarrassment in 1962 indo-sino conflict.
  <br><br><mark>At the end each cell of my body and each thought of my mind believes that best days of India is yet to come.</mark></p>
